## Overview
Investment accounts fall broadly into **taxable** and **tax-advantaged** (such as IRAs). The main differences are how contributions, growth, and withdrawals are taxed.

## Taxable Brokerage Accounts
- Funded with **after-tax** dollars.
- Dividends and interest are generally **taxable in the year received**.
- Realized capital gains are taxable when you sell investments.
- No contribution limits and no required minimum distributions (RMDs).

### When They Are Useful
- Flexible goal saving (not just retirement).
- Short- to medium-term goals where liquidity matters.
- Supplementing retirement accounts once tax-advantaged limits are reached.

## Traditional IRA
- Contributions may be **tax-deductible**, subject to income and plan coverage rules.
- Growth is **tax-deferred**; taxes are paid when withdrawing.
- Withdrawals in retirement are generally taxed as **ordinary income**.
- **RMDs** usually start at a specified age based on current legislation.

## Roth IRA
- Contributions are made with **after-tax** dollars (no deduction).
- Qualified withdrawals of contributions and growth are generally **tax-free**.
- No RMDs for the original owner under current rules (subject to change).
- There are **income eligibility limits** for direct Roth contributions.

## Choosing Between Them (High-Level)
- Expect higher income and tax bracket in the future → Roth may be attractive.
- Expect lower income and tax bracket in retirement → Traditional may be attractive.
- Taxable accounts can complement both for liquidity and flexibility.
