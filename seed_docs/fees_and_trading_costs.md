## Types of Fees
- **Expense Ratios:** Ongoing fees charged by mutual funds and ETFs, expressed as a percentage of assets.
- **Advisory Fees:** Fees paid to an investment adviser, often as a percentage of assets under management.
- **Transaction Fees/Commissions:** Costs associated with buying or selling certain securities, depending on the platform.

## Trading Considerations
- **Bid–Ask Spread:** The difference between the price to buy and the price to sell; wider spreads can increase trading costs.
- **Slippage:** The difference between the expected transaction price and the executed price, often due to market movement or liquidity.
- **Order Types:** Market orders trade immediately at current prices; limit orders specify a minimum or maximum price you are willing to accept.

## Why Costs Matter
Even small differences in fees can compound over long time horizons. Lower overall costs can help more of your returns stay in your account, all else equal.
