## Employer Match
Many workplace retirement plans (such as 401(k)s) offer an **employer match** on employee contributions.

### Example
- Employer matches **50% of employee contributions up to 6% of salary**.
- If you contribute 6% of salary, the employer adds another 3% (effectively free compensation subject to plan rules).

## Vesting
**Vesting** describes how much of the employer contributions you are entitled to keep if you leave the company.

- **Immediate vesting:** You own employer contributions right away.
- **Graded vesting:** Ownership increases over time (for example, 20% per year).
- **Cliff vesting:** 0% vested until a set number of years, then 100% vested.

## Why It Matters
- Ensuring you contribute enough to receive the **full match** is often considered a priority in many financial frameworks.
- Understanding the vesting schedule helps you see the potential value of staying with an employer longer.
