## What Is a Glidepath?
A **glidepath** describes how a portfolio’s risk level (usually equity % vs fixed income %) changes over time, typically as an investor approaches a target date such as retirement.

## Target Date Funds (TDFs)
- A TDF is usually labeled by year (for example, *2045 Fund*).
- The fund’s manager gradually **shifts from higher equity** to **higher fixed income** as the target date approaches.
- The investor picks a fund roughly aligned with their expected retirement date.

## Typical Glidepath Shape
- Early years: Higher equity allocation (e.g., 80–90% stocks).
- Mid-career: Gradual shift (e.g., 60–70% stocks).
- Near retirement: More fixed income and cash (e.g., 40% stocks or less, depending on design).

## Considerations
- Two TDFs with the same year can have **different risk levels** and underlying strategies.
- Glidepaths can be **“to”** retirement (risk stabilizes at the date) or **“through”** retirement (risk continues to change after).
- TDFs can be a convenient all-in-one option but are still subject to market risk.
