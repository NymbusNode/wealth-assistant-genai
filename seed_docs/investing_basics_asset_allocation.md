## What Is Asset Allocation?
Asset allocation is how you divide a portfolio among **stocks, bonds, cash, and other asset classes**. It is a primary driver of both **risk** and **return**.

## Common Asset Classes
- **Equities (Stocks):** Higher long-term growth potential, higher volatility.
- **Fixed Income (Bonds):** Income and lower volatility than stocks, but still subject to risk.
- **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** Stability and liquidity; typically lowest expected return.
- **Alternatives:** Real estate, commodities, and other non-traditional assets.

## Drivers of Allocation
Key inputs when designing an allocation:
- **Time Horizon:** How long until you need the money.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Comfort with short-term fluctuations.
- **Financial Capacity:** Ability to handle losses without disrupting your plan.
- **Goals:** Retirement, home purchase, education, etc.

## Example Allocations
- **Conservative:** 30% Stocks / 60% Bonds / 10% Cash
- **Moderate:** 60% Stocks / 35% Bonds / 5% Cash
- **Aggressive:** 80% Stocks / 20% Bonds

## Why Rebalancing Matters
Market movements will change your allocation over time. A rebalancing policy helps you:
- Control risk.
- Systematically “sell high, buy low”.
- Stay aligned with your Investment Policy Statement (IPS).
