## Why Rebalance
Rebalancing controls risk by restoring the target mix after market moves. It also enforces a disciplined “sell high, buy low” process instead of reacting emotionally to markets.

## Common Drift Rules
Two frequently used approaches:
- **Calendar-based:** Review and rebalance on a fixed schedule (for example, annually or semi-annually).
- **Threshold-based:** Rebalance when any asset class deviates by more than a preset amount from its target, such as:
  - ±5 percentage points, or
  - ±25% of the asset class’s target weight (the “5/25 rule”).

## Example
Target allocation: 60% stocks / 40% bonds.
- If stocks rise to 66% and bonds fall to 34%, the equity sleeve is 6 percentage points above target → may trigger rebalancing.
- If a sleeve with a 10% target grows to 13%, that is a 30% increase from target → may also trigger rebalancing.

## Tax-Aware Rebalancing
Priority order in many frameworks:
1. Rebalance inside **tax-advantaged accounts** first (IRAs, 401(k)s).
2. Use **new contributions and dividends** in taxable accounts to move toward target.
3. Realize capital gains in taxable accounts only when necessary and in a tax-aware manner.
