## Duration (Interest Rate Sensitivity)
- **Duration** measures how sensitive a bond’s price is to changes in interest rates.
- Higher duration → larger price moves for a given rate change.
- Long-term bonds generally have higher duration than short-term bonds.

### Example
If a bond fund has a duration of 6, a 1% rise in interest rates could lead to an approximate **6% price decline**, all else equal.

## Credit Quality
- **Credit rating** reflects the issuer’s perceived ability to meet obligations.
- Higher credit quality (e.g., U.S. Treasuries, investment-grade corporates) tends to have lower default risk and lower yields.
- Lower credit quality (high-yield bonds) offers higher potential yield but higher risk.

## Yield Curve
- The **yield curve** plots yields of similar-quality bonds across different maturities.
- A typical **upward-sloping** curve: longer maturities offer higher yields.
- A **flat or inverted** curve can signal market expectations about growth and interest rates.

## Role in a Portfolio
- Bonds can provide income and diversification versus equities.
- The mix of duration and credit risk should reflect risk tolerance and time horizon.
