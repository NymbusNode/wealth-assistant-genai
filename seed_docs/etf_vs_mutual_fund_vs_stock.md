## Individual Stocks
- Represent direct ownership in a single company.
- Potential for high return and high risk.
- Requires security-specific research and monitoring.
- Concentrated positions can increase portfolio volatility.

## Mutual Funds
- Pooled investments managed by a professional manager or team.
- Can be **active** (manager selects securities) or **index** (tracks a benchmark).
- Typically priced once per day at **net asset value (NAV)**.
- Often have internal expense ratios and may include additional share class fees.

## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
- Hybrid structure that trades like a stock but typically tracks a **specific index**.
- Intraday liquidity: can buy or sell throughout the trading day.
- Many ETFs are designed to be **low-cost and tax-efficient**, especially broad index ETFs.
- Like mutual funds, they provide diversification across many securities.

## Choosing a Vehicle
Consider:
- **Costs:** Expense ratios, transaction fees, potential sales loads.
- **Tax Efficiency:** ETFs are often more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.
- **Strategy:** Broad index exposure vs active management.
- **Convenience:** Tolerance for managing individual stocks vs owning diversified funds.
