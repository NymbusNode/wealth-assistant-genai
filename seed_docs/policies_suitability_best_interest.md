## Suitability Standard (High Level)
Historically, many brokers were held to a **suitability** standard. A recommendation had to be:
- Reasonable for the client based on their **profile** (age, income, risk tolerance, objectives).
- Not necessarily the **lowest cost** or the absolute “best” available option.

## Best Interest Standard
Under more recent regulations (such as Regulation Best Interest in the U.S.), brokers making recommendations to retail customers must act in the customer's **best interest** at the time of the recommendation, considering:
- Costs and reasonable alternatives.
- The client’s circumstances and objectives.
- Firm and representative conflicts of interest, and how they are mitigated or disclosed.

## Key Considerations
- Understanding the client’s **investment profile** is central (time horizon, risk tolerance, goals).
- Documentation of rationale and alternatives is important from a process standpoint.
- Ongoing monitoring may or may not be required depending on the engagement type (one-time recommendation vs ongoing advice).
