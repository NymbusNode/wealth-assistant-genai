## Investment Policy Statement (IPS) and Risk Bands
An **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)** documents how a portfolio should be managed. A common element is a set of **target allocations** tied to risk profiles.

## Example Target Allocations
- **Conservative:** 30% Stocks / 60% Bonds / 10% Cash  
  Focus on capital preservation and income.
- **Moderate:** 60% Stocks / 35% Bonds / 5% Cash  
  Balance of growth and income.
- **Aggressive:** 80% Stocks / 20% Bonds  
  Greater focus on long-term growth with higher volatility.

## Time Horizon and Adjustments
- As the time horizon shortens, many investors gradually shift toward more conservative allocations.
- Life events (retirement, major purchases, changes in income) can warrant IPS review and potential adjustments.

## Rebalancing and Drift
- The IPS often specifies **rebalancing frequency** and **drift bands** to keep the portfolio around target allocations.
- See the related document on **Rebalancing Policy and Drift Thresholds** for more detail.
