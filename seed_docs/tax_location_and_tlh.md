## Tax Location
Tax location is about **placing the right investments in the right account types** to improve after-tax returns.

### Typical Guidelines (High Level)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Favor tax-efficient holdings such as broad equity index ETFs.
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (Traditional IRA/401(k)):** Hold income-heavy or less tax-efficient investments (bonds, REITs, actively managed funds).
- **Roth Accounts:** Prioritize higher-growth assets, as qualified withdrawals are generally tax-free under current rules.

## Tax-Loss Harvesting (TLH)
TLH is the practice of realizing investment losses in taxable accounts to offset gains and potentially reduce current taxes.

### Key Points
- Realized capital losses can offset capital gains and up to a limited amount of ordinary income (subject to current rules).
- Proceeds are typically reinvested in a **similar, but not substantially identical** investment to maintain market exposure.
- The **wash-sale rule** generally disallows losses if you repurchase the same or substantially identical securities around the sale window (e.g., within 30 days before or after).

## Example
An investor sells a broad U.S. equity ETF at a loss and immediately buys a different broad U.S. equity ETF with similar exposure but from another provider, seeking to maintain risk profile while realizing the loss.
