## Traditional IRA (High Level)
- Contributions may be **tax-deductible** depending on income and coverage by a workplace plan.
- Investments grow **tax-deferred**.
- Withdrawals in retirement are generally taxed as ordinary income.
- Subject to **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)** beginning at a certain age according to current law.

## Roth IRA (High Level)
- Contributions are made with **after-tax** dollars (no immediate deduction).
- Qualified withdrawals of earnings are generally **tax-free**, if rules are satisfied.
- No RMDs for the original owner under current rules (inheritance rules may differ).

## Comparing Roth vs Traditional
Key factors often considered:
- Current vs expected future tax bracket.
- Flexibility and desire for tax-free income in retirement.
- Eligibility for direct Roth contributions or deductibility of Traditional IRA contributions.

## RMD Basics (Simplified)
- RMDs are **minimum amounts** that must be withdrawn from certain retirement accounts each year once you reach the applicable starting age.
- Failure to take RMDs can result in tax penalties under current law.
- Roth IRAs generally do not have RMDs for the original owner, while Traditional IRAs do.
